    The dataset is located at:Sample.csv

Here is what I want to do:

<!-- I want a python Script script that reads this CSV file, removes duplicate rows, groups the data by 'A', and then calculates the total 'C' for each A. -->

I want a python Script script that reads this CSV file gives unique values of column B.

Return only the code. Don't explain anything.
